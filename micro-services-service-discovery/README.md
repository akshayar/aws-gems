<BR>In the Cloudformation approach ALB, a listener and a default target group is created in one CloudFormation template. The listener ARN is exported as an output parameter. In another Cloudformation template autoscaling group, launch configuration, target group and listener rule is created for the web service. The reference to ALB listener is imported. The second set of stack will be created for each web service.
<BR>In this example amio-fmr-alb.json creates ALB , listener and default target group. amio-fmr-ec2.json creates autoscaling group, launch configuration, target group and listener rule for each web service. amio-fmr-ec2-iam.json created required role for each web service.
